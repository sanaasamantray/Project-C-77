    <p>Visiual studio is a very good platform for coding it has more good features than any other platform and its advanced too.</p>
    <p>Its really very easy to open console.Just right click on the screen then you will see a option as inspect click on that and then console will be there.Console is really very usefull because if there is something error, so you can jus check it on the output screen itself.</p>
